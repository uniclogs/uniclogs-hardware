### Linear power amplifier

Power amplifiers using hybrid power amplifier modules from
Mitsubishi or Hitachi are used to drive the antenna.

See:
* 2m:   Hitachi SAV33 MOSFET
* 70cm: Hitachi SAU83L MOSFET
* 23cm: Mitsubishi RA18H1213G

Testing data is included in the spreadsheet, including characteristics of the power output monitor voltage.

Additionally, the output of most SDR transmitter sections is a little too low to fully drive the power amplifiers, so inline MMIC Pre-Drivers are placed in front of the PA.

We use the GALI-84 Driver from MiniKits.Com.Au to drive all three power amplifiers. One for each power amplifier.
